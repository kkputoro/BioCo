          Our carefully crafted system lets citizens dispose waste in an effective and efficient manner via our app. This app lets the users select between the type of waste
          that is being disposed and segregate them at the first level, thereby reducing the cost of managing the waste. This is then collected by our staff and taken to
          our recyling facility where all items that can be recyled are picked up and put to use again.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our aim is to reduce the waste that reaches the landfills as much as possible. People do not understand the importanc of waste segregation, and to give an insight,
          improperly disposed waste or unsegregated waste can act as a breeding ground for insects which spread diseases, affecting the health of humans and puts our lives
          at risk.
          <br>
          <br>
          BioCo may not be the best solution out there, however it is one step closer to making our planet sustainable and the quality of our lives better.
